# Udemy course content

In short, what it does is to create a string that is displayed in the console with the course contents (sections and chapters).

Ideally for use in conjunction with [obsidian-to-anki-card-converter](https://github.com/envico801/obsidian-to-anki-card-converter)

## How to use it

Simply add it as a script inside tampermonkey. It will probably work with other script/userscripts managers, you just need to change it a bit to suit your needs.
